# 🍰 FruitcakeAI v5 — Rebuild Roadmap

**Version**: 5.5  
**Status**: Phase 1 ✅ · Phase 2 ✅ · Phase 3 ✅ · Phase 4 ✅ · Phase 5.1 ✅ · Phase 5.2 ✅ · Phase 5.3 ✅ · Phase 5.4 Hardening (In Progress)  
**Philosophy**: Agent-first. Air-gapped by default. Knows its people.  
**Build Location**: `/Users/jwomble/Development/fruitcake_v5/`  
**Last Updated**: March 9, 2026  
**Checkpoint Note**: Phase 5.4 is a pre-Phase-6 reliability gate (MCP + execution profile hardening).

---

## Executive Summary

FruitcakeAI v5 is a clean rebuild that preserves the best ideas from v3/v4 — hybrid RAG retrieval, multi-user/persona support, MCP tool integration — while discarding the complexity that made v3/v4 cumbersome.

The core mental model evolution:

> **v3/v4**: A platform that contains an AI  
> **v5**: An AI agent that has tools  
> **v5 Phase 4+**: An AI agent that knows its people and acts without being prompted

### What Makes FruitcakeAI Different From OpenClaw

OpenClaw is optimized for a single power user who wants maximum connectivity and tool surface. FruitcakeAI optimizes for something different: a trusted, private, multi-user system that genuinely knows the people it serves — and gets better at knowing them over time.

| Dimension | OpenClaw | FruitcakeAI |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Users | Single power user | Family / small team, multi-user |
| Memory | Flat MEMORY.md + HEARTBEAT.md | Persistent per-user memory in pgvector |
| Heartbeat context | Reads a markdown file | Semantically retrieves what's been relevant for this person lately |
| RAG | SQLite-vec + FTS5 | pgvector + BM25 + RRF fusion + reranking |
| Document library | Flat workspace files | Full ingest pipeline, per-user scoping |
| Safety | Single-user, no controls | Persona-scoped tools, kids safety, role-based access |
| Security | Cloud-first | Air-gapped by default, cloud opt-in per signal type |
| Mobile | Telegram dependency | Native Swift, APNs, on-device FoundationModels fallback |

The memory system is the core differentiator. OpenClaw's heartbeat knows what's in your checklist. FruitcakeAI's heartbeat knows *you*.

## ⚠️ Ground Truth: Verified Working Configuration

### Hardware
- **Machine**: M1 Max, 64GB RAM (macOS)
- **Verified LLM**: `qwen2.5:14b` via Ollama ✅
- **`llama3.3:70b`** (~43GB): crashes Ollama — memory pressure with embedding model + macOS overhead
- **`qwen2.5:32b`** (~20GB): viable step-up if other apps closed first

### LiteLLM / Ollama Critical Patterns

```env
LLM_MODEL=ollama_chat/qwen2.5:14b   # ✅ /api/chat — tool calling works
# LLM_MODEL=ollama/qwen2.5:14b     # ❌ /api/generate — tool calls silently broken
```

```python
# Always pass api_base explicitly — strip trailing /v1
def _litellm_kwargs(self) -> dict:
    base = settings.local_api_base.rstrip("/")
    if base.endswith("/v1"):
        base = base[:-3]
    return {"api_base": base, "model": settings.llm_model}

# Check message.tool_calls — not finish_reason
while message.tool_calls:   # ✅ Ollama returns stop even with tool calls present
    ...

# _normalize_tool_calls() required — Ollama format inconsistent across model versions
```

## Memory Architecture

Memory is FruitcakeAI's primary differentiator. OpenClaw reads a flat HEARTBEAT.md checklist every 30 minutes. FruitcakeAI retrieves semantically relevant context about *this specific person* before every heartbeat and task run. The assistant doesn't just check a list — it reasons in light of what it knows.

### Memory Types

Three distinct types with different retrieval and lifecycle behavior:

| Type | What it stores | Lifecycle | Retrieval |
|------|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| `episodic` | Events, facts with time context, things that happened | Expires (time-bound) | Semantic similarity + recency |
| `semantic` | Persistent facts about the person's life, preferences, relationships | Never expires unless changed | Always included (small set) |
| `procedural` | How to behave with this person | Never expires | Always injected into system prompt |

**Examples:**
- *"Sarah's mom had surgery this week"* → episodic, importance 0.9, expires in 30 days
- *"James prefers conservative financial options first"* → semantic, importance 0.7
- *"Always use bullet points for Sarah's task summaries"* → procedural, importance 0.8
- *"Dentist appointment confirmed for Thursday 2pm"* → episodic, importance 0.85, expires in 7 days

### DB Model

```python
class Memory(Base):
    __tablename__ = "memories"
    
    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)
    user_id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(ForeignKey("users.id"))
    
    # Content
    content: Mapped[str]
    memory_type: Mapped[str]              # "episodic" | "semantic" | "procedural"
    
    # Source tracking — full audit trail
    source: Mapped[str]                   # "agent" | "task" | "explicit" | "extracted"
    source_session_id: Mapped[int | None] = mapped_column(ForeignKey("chat_sessions.id"))
    source_task_id: Mapped[int | None] = mapped_column(ForeignKey("tasks.id"))
    
    # Retrieval
    embedding: Mapped[Vector(384)]        # same dim as existing BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5
    
    # Relevance management
    importance: Mapped[float] = mapped_column(default=0.5)    # 0.0–1.0, agent-set
    confidence: Mapped[float] = mapped_column(default=0.8)    # how certain is this
    access_count: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(default=0)      # feedback loop
    last_accessed_at: Mapped[datetime | None]
    
    # Lifecycle
    created_at: Mapped[datetime] = mapped_column(server_default=func.now())
    expires_at: Mapped[datetime | None]    # None = never expires
    is_active: Mapped[bool] = mapped_column(default=True)
    
    # Optional
    tags: Mapped[list[str]] = mapped_column(ARRAY(String), default=[])
```

**Design notes:**
- Memories are **immutable** — never edited, only deactivated. If something changes ("Sarah was promoted"), the agent creates a new memory and marks the old one `is_active=False`. Audit trail preserved.
- `access_count` + `last_accessed_at` create a natural feedback loop. Frequently retrieved memories are demonstrably useful; rarely accessed ones are candidates for pruning. ⚠️ **The loop must be closed explicitly**: high `access_count` should raise `importance`; zero accesses over 30 days should flag as a pruning candidate. The `MemoryService` pruning job (Phase 8) handles bulk cleanup, but a lightweight inline adjustment on `_record_access()` — e.g. `importance = min(1.0, importance + 0.02)` per access — keeps scores meaningful before then. Without this, importance values drift stale and the ranking signal degrades.
- `expires_at` is agent-settable. The `create_memory` tool accepts `expires_in_days`. Time-bound information (appointments, deadlines, temporary situations) should always expire.
- Embedding uses the same BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 model already running for document RAG. No new model required.
- ⚠️ **Memory scope is per-user only in Phase 4.** Family-level facts ("the Johnsons go camping every August") are not addressable — each user's heartbeat would rediscover them independently. A future `scope` field (`"personal" | "family" | "shared"`) on `Memory` would mirror the library scoping model and allow family-relevant memories to surface across all users. Deferred to Phase 5+.

### Memory Creation

**Primary path — agent tool call:**

The agent receives a `create_memory` tool alongside its existing tool set. One line in the system prompt does the rest: *"Use create_memory when you learn something important about the user that should inform future interactions."*

```python
async def create_memory(
    content: str,
    memory_type: Literal["episodic", "semantic", "procedural"],
    importance: float = 0.5,
    expires_in_days: int | None = None,
    tags: list[str] = []
) -> str:
    """
    Store something worth remembering about the current user.

    episodic: events, facts with time context, things that happened.
    semantic: persistent facts — preferences, relationships, standing info.
    procedural: how to behave with this user in future interactions.

    Set expires_in_days for time-bound info (appointments, deadlines, current situations).
    Set importance 0.8+ for things that should surface in future heartbeats.
    """
```

⚠️ **Write-time deduplication is required.** The nightly extraction job deduplicates before inserting, but the live `create_memory` agent path does not. A user who mentions their bullet-point preference in three sessions will accumulate three near-identical procedural memories — all three will be retrieved, wasting token budget and degrading ranking. `MemoryService.create()` must run a similarity check before inserting:

```python
# In MemoryService.create() — before db.add(memory)
embedding = await embed(content)
duplicate = await db.execute(
    select(Memory)
    .where(Memory.user_id == user_id, Memory.is_active == True,
           Memory.embedding.cosine_distance(embedding) < 0.12)
    .limit(1)
)
if duplicate.scalar_one_or_none():
    return "Memory already exists (duplicate suppressed)"
```

The 0.12 cosine distance threshold keeps near-verbatim duplicates out while allowing genuinely distinct updates. Tune after real usage data.

**Secondary path — nightly extraction job:**

After Phase 4 ships and real data accumulates, a nightly background task reviews the previous 24 hours of chat sessions and extracts memories the agent didn't explicitly create. This catches things the agent noted but didn't persist — patterns that only become obvious in retrospect.

The extraction prompt is simple: *"Review this conversation. Extract any facts about the user that would be useful to remember in future sessions. Format as JSON list of {content, type, importance, expires_in_days}."*

**Explicit path — user-created:**

Via the Memories UI in Swift Settings. Users can write memories directly, edit importance, delete memories. Full control over what the assistant knows.

### Memory Retrieval

`app/memory/service.py` — called before every heartbeat and task run:

```python
class MemoryService:

    async def retrieve_for_context(
        self,
        user_id: int,
        query: str,
        max_tokens: int = 400
    ) -> MemoryContext:
        
        # Tier 1: Always include — semantic + procedural (standing facts)
        # These are small, high-value, always relevant to this person
        standing = await self._get_standing_memories(user_id)
        
        # Tier 2: Recent high-importance episodic (last 7 days, importance ≥ 0.6)
        recent = await self._get_recent_episodic(
            user_id, days=7, min_importance=0.6
        )
        
        # Tier 3: Semantically similar episodic memories
        # "check calendar for conflicts" → retrieves past calendar-related memories
        similar = await self._get_similar(
            user_id=user_id,
            query=query,
            memory_types=["episodic"],
            limit=5
        )
        
        # Deduplicate, rank by (similarity × importance × recency), truncate to budget
        merged = self._rank_and_truncate(
            standing + recent + similar,
            max_tokens=max_tokens
        )
        
        await self._record_access(merged)
        return MemoryContext(memories=merged)

    async def _get_similar(self, user_id, query, memory_types, limit):
        embedding = await embed(query)
        return await db.execute(
            select(Memory)
            .where(
                Memory.user_id == user_id,
                Memory.memory_type.in_(memory_types),
                Memory.is_active == True,
                or_(Memory.expires_at > datetime.utcnow(), Memory.expires_at.is_(None))
            )
            .order_by(Memory.embedding.cosine_distance(embedding))
            .limit(limit)
        )
```

### What the Heartbeat Prompt Looks Like

```
[Heartbeat for Sarah — Tuesday 8:15am ET]

What I know about Sarah:
• Always use bullet points for her summaries [procedural]
• Prefers to be contacted in the morning [semantic]
• Mom had surgery this week — check in if appropriate [episodic, imp: 0.9]
• Thompson project deadline is Friday [episodic, imp: 0.85]
• Asked about rescheduling Tuesday 2pm meeting yesterday [episodic, imp: 0.7]

Checklist:
- Check calendar for conflicts in next 24 hours
- Review any pending task approvals

Current time: Tuesday 8:15am (within active hours 7am–10pm ✓)

If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
```

The agent has genuine personal context before making any tool calls. It knows about the surgery, knows about the deadline, knows about the meeting. It doesn't need to rediscover these things — it reasons from them immediately.

### Memory Management API + Swift UI

```
GET    /memories              list user's active memories (paginated, filterable by type)
POST   /memories              create memory explicitly
PATCH  /memories/{id}         update importance, tags, or deactivate
DELETE /memories/{id}         deactivate (soft delete — audit trail preserved)
```

**Swift — Memories section in Settings:**
- List grouped by type (Procedural · Semantic · Episodic)
- Each row: content + type badge + importance dot + age
- Swipe to delete
- Tap to view source ("From conversation on March 3" / "From task: Morning briefing")
- Search/filter
- This is the answer to "why did it mention my dentist appointment?" — transparent and auditable

---

## Phase 4 — Memory + Heartbeat + Autonomous Tasks (~3 weeks)

**Goal**: FruitcakeAI acts without being prompted — and does so with genuine knowledge of each person it serves.

### What This Phase Borrows From OpenClaw (Proven)

- **LLM-as-judgment-router**: no pre-built context aggregator. The agent calls its normal tools to gather what it needs. The instruction *is* the context directive.
- **HEARTBEAT_OK suppression**: if the agent decides nothing needs attention, return the token and suppress delivery silently. Zero noise to the user.
- **Isolated sessions for tasks**: task runs create their own `ChatSession` rows, hidden from chat UI, so background work never pollutes conversation history.
- **Active hours**: heartbeat skips outside configured hours. A 3am notification is a product-killing failure mode.
- **Exponential retry backoff**: a task that fails once does not fail forever. Transient errors (network, rate limit) retry with backoff; permanent errors (auth failure, config) disable immediately.
- **Session cleanup**: task sessions are pruned after 24 hours. Background work doesn't accumulate dead session rows indefinitely.

### What This Phase Adds Beyond OpenClaw

- **Per-user persistent memory** in pgvector — retrieved semantically, injected into every heartbeat and task prompt
- **`create_memory` agent tool** — agent persists what it learns during chat and task execution
- **Multi-user scope enforcement** in the task runner — tasks inherit the owning user's persona scopes; no privilege escalation
- **Approval workflow** for irreversible actions — task pauses with `waiting_approval` status, APNs push asks the user, resume on confirmation
- **Native APNs push** — not Telegram, not webhooks. Real iOS notifications via the Swift client

### What This Phase Intentionally Defers

The `JudgmentRouter` and `ContextSanitizer` from Roadmap 4 are removed entirely. They solved a problem that doesn't exist until cloud LLM routing is actually opted into. Adding them now would be dead code and added complexity. The cloud routing path (`config/autonomy.yaml`) will be added as a focused sprint when the first user asks for it. Until then, local model only — air-gapped by default, no config required.

### Sprint 4.1 — DB Models + Memory Foundation (Days 1–4)

> ⚠️ **This sprint is dense.** It covers: Memory + Task + DeviceToken DB models, `MemoryService` (including write-time dedup and retrieval tiers), the `create_memory` agent tool, three new API modules (`tasks.py`, `devices.py`, `memories.py`), schedule parsing, and Alembic migrations. Budget 5–6 days if the memory retrieval ranking or deduplication logic runs longer than expected. Sprint 4.2 (runner + scheduler) has a hard dependency on all of 4.1 shipping — do not start 4.2 until migrations are applied and `MemoryService.retrieve_for_context()` is tested.

**New DB models** (`app/db/models.py`):

```python
class Memory(Base):
    __tablename__ = "memories"
    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)
    user_id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(ForeignKey("users.id"))
    content: Mapped[str]
    memory_type: Mapped[str]              # "episodic" | "semantic" | "procedural"
    source: Mapped[str]                   # "agent" | "task" | "explicit" | "extracted"
    source_session_id: Mapped[int | None] = mapped_column(ForeignKey("chat_sessions.id"))
    source_task_id: Mapped[int | None] = mapped_column(ForeignKey("tasks.id"))
    embedding: Mapped[Vector(384)]
    importance: Mapped[float] = mapped_column(default=0.5)
    confidence: Mapped[float] = mapped_column(default=0.8)
    access_count: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(default=0)
    last_accessed_at: Mapped[datetime | None]
    created_at: Mapped[datetime] = mapped_column(server_default=func.now())
    expires_at: Mapped[datetime | None]
    is_active: Mapped[bool] = mapped_column(default=True)
    tags: Mapped[list[str]] = mapped_column(ARRAY(String), default=[])


class Task(Base):
    __tablename__ = "tasks"
    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)
    user_id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(ForeignKey("users.id"))
    title: Mapped[str]
    instruction: Mapped[str]              # natural language prompt for the agent
    task_type: Mapped[str]               # "one_shot" | "recurring"
    status: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(default="pending")
                                          # pending | running | completed | failed
                                          # cancelled | waiting_approval
    schedule: Mapped[str | None]          # cron expr | "every:30m" | ISO timestamp
    deliver: Mapped[bool] = mapped_column(default=True)
    requires_approval: Mapped[bool] = mapped_column(default=False)
    result: Mapped[str | None]
    error: Mapped[str | None]
    retry_count: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(default=0)
    next_retry_at: Mapped[datetime | None]
    active_hours_start: Mapped[str | None]    # "08:00"
    active_hours_end: Mapped[str | None]      # "22:00"
    active_hours_tz: Mapped[str | None]       # "America/New_York"
    created_at: Mapped[datetime] = mapped_column(server_default=func.now())
    last_run_at: Mapped[datetime | None]
    next_run_at: Mapped[datetime | None]


class DeviceToken(Base):
    __tablename__ = "device_tokens"
    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)
    user_id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(ForeignKey("users.id"))
    token: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(unique=True)
    environment: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(default="sandbox")
    created_at: Mapped[datetime] = mapped_column(server_default=func.now())
```

Add `is_task_session: Mapped[bool] = mapped_column(default=False)` to `ChatSession`.

**New module: `app/memory/service.py`** — `MemoryService` with `retrieve_for_context()`, `create()`, `deactivate()`, `_record_access()`.

**New agent tool** (`app/agent/tools.py`): `create_memory` — registered alongside existing tools.

**Alembic migration**: `memories`, `tasks`, `device_tokens` tables + `chat_sessions.is_task_session`.

**New API** (`app/api/tasks.py`, `app/api/devices.py`, `app/api/memories.py`):

```

APNS_AUTH_KEY_PATH=./certs/AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8
APNS_BUNDLE_ID=none.FruitcakeAi
APNS_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox          # sandbox | production
```

**Swift — APNs registration** (`FruitcakeAiApp.swift`):

```swift
UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(options: [.alert, .sound, .badge]) { _, _ in }
UIApplication.shared.registerForRemoteNotifications()

func application(_ app: UIApplication,
                 didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken token: Data) {
    let hex = token.map { String(format: "%02x", $0) }.joined()

                                    body: ["token": hex, "environment": "sandbox"])
    }
}
```

---

### Sprint 4.4 — Inbox Tab + Memory UI (Days 14–21)

**Swift — Inbox tab** (`Views/Inbox/`):

```
Views/
├── Inbox/
│   ├── InboxView.swift           # Main list: pending approvals + recent task results
│   ├── TaskRow.swift             # Status badge (green/blue/red/orange/gray)
│   └── TaskCreateSheet.swift     # Create/edit task form
```

Status badge colors: `completed` → green · `running` → blue + spinner · `failed` → red · `waiting_approval` → orange + Approve/Reject buttons · `cancelled` → gray.

`TaskCreateSheet` fields: Title · Instruction (multiline) · Schedule picker (one-time / every 30m / 1h / 6h / 12h / daily / custom cron) · Active hours toggle · Push when done toggle · Require approval toggle.

**`ContentView.swift`** — add Inbox tab with approval badge:

```swift
TabView {
    Tab("Chat",    systemImage: "bubble.left.and.bubble.right") { ChatView() }
    Tab("Inbox",   systemImage: "envelope.badge") { InboxView() }
        .badge(pendingApprovalCount)
    Tab("Library", systemImage: "books.vertical") { LibraryView() }
    Tab("Settings",systemImage: "gear") { SettingsView() }
}
```

**Swift — Memories section in Settings** (`Views/Settings/MemoriesView.swift`):

- List grouped by type: Procedural → Semantic → Episodic
- Each row: content + type badge + importance dot (●●○ etc.) + age
- Swipe to delete (calls `DELETE /memories/{id}`)
- Tap → detail: full content, source attribution ("From conversation March 3" / "From task: Morning briefing"), importance slider
- Search bar filters across all types

---

## Phase 5 — Webhooks + External Triggers (1 week)

**Sprint 5.1** — Inbound webhook surface:

```python
class WebhookConfig(Base):
    __tablename__ = "webhook_configs"
    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)
    user_id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(ForeignKey("users.id"))
    name: Mapped[str]
    webhook_key: Mapped[str]          # random secret — appears in POST /webhooks/{key}
    instruction: Mapped[str]           # what agent does when triggered
    active: Mapped[bool] = mapped_column(default=True)
```

```
POST   /webhooks/{key}   inbound trigger (GitHub, Zapier, IFTTT, etc.)
GET    /webhooks         list
POST   /webhooks         create
DELETE /webhooks/{id}    remove
```

**Sprint 5.2** — Gmail Pub/Sub (`app/mcp/servers/gmail.py`):

Tools: `read_email`, `send_email`, `search_emails`, `label_email`. Gmail push → Pub/Sub → `/webhooks/{key}` → agent wakes with memory context injected.

### Phase 5.3 — Completed (Task Persona Routing + Runner Stability)

Shipped outcomes:
- Removed brittle, domain-specific task-runner orchestration instructions (news mode rollback).
- Added task-level persona support:
  - `tasks.persona` column + migration
  - `/tasks` `POST`/`PATCH`/`GET`/list include persona behavior
- Added deterministic persona routing from `config/personas.yaml` via `persona_router`.
- Introduced execution profile seam:
  - `resolve_execution_profile(task, user)`
  - returns `persona`, `allowed_tools`, `blocked_tools`
- Added lazy backfill for legacy tasks with null persona at execution time.
- Hardened MCP stdio stream handling for large Playwright payloads.

Verification highlights:
- Task persona inference and explicit override behavior validated in API tests.
- Resolver integration validated in runner tests (explicit persona + lazy backfill).
- Large-page Playwright `browser_navigate` no longer fails with separator/chunk limit error.

### Phase 5.4 — Pre-Phase-6 Hardening Gate

**Goal**: Stabilize execution/tool reliability and observability before any cloud judgment routing.

#### Phase 5.4.x — Completed in This Branch (Checkpoint)

Shipped outcomes:
- Added stage-based task model routing for autonomous paths (tasks + webhooks):
  - planning model
  - execution model
  - final synthesis model
- Added configurable large-model fallback retries for qualifying non-final step failures.
- Extended agent core interface for model routing:
  - `run_agent(..., model_override=..., stage=...)`
  - `stream_agent(..., model_override=..., stage=...)`
- Added model-stage observability counters and surfaced them through metrics/admin diagnostics.
- Hardened RSS task behavior:
  - expanded fake/synthetic feed URL guardrails
  - `search_my_feeds` empty-query behavior returns recent headlines instead of hard-failing
  - `search_feeds` invalid-URL path can recover to curated feed search when user context exists

Validation checkpoint:
- Routing + regression suites passed in `fruitcake_v5`.
- RSS/MCP suites passed after hardening and fallback updates.
- Changes are additive; no API-breaking removals.

#### Sprint 5.4.1 — MCP runtime reliability
- Add per-client request serialization lock in MCP client.
- Add reconnect + one retry for EOF/broken pipe/timeout scenarios.
- Add stderr ring buffer capture for Docker MCP clients.

#### Sprint 5.4.2 — Registry and tool contract hardening
- Add deterministic duplicate-tool-name policy (no silent overrides).
- Add optional alias/prefix strategy in MCP config.
- Keep internal `web_search`/`fetch_page` as the stable primary web contract.

#### Sprint 5.4.3 — Admin observability
- Expand `/admin/tools` diagnostics with last error, connection state, and server health.
- Add `/admin/mcp/diagnostics` endpoint for targeted checks.

#### Sprint 5.4.4 — Execution profile v1 formalization
- Keep resolver persona-derived for now.
- Document extension path for future merge of:
  - persona
  - capability profile
  - user policy
  - task overrides

#### Sprint 5.4.5 — Profile-driven execution extraction
- Added task profile contract (`tasks.profile`) with runtime default resolution to `default`.
- Added profile modules under `autonomy/profiles/`:
  - `default`
  - `news_magazine`
  - resolver + shared profile interface hooks
- Refactored planner to use profile-owned planning (`plan_steps`) instead of inline magazine special-casing.
- Refactored runner to use profile hooks for:
  - run-context preparation (`prepare_run_context`)
  - prompt augmentation (`augment_prompt`)
  - effective blocked tool policy (`effective_blocked_tools`)
  - finalize validation (`validate_finalize`)
  - standardized artifact emission (`artifact_payloads`)
- Standardized profile artifact types:
  - `prepared_dataset`, `draft_output`, `final_output`, `validation_report`, `run_diagnostics`
- Added API-level profile validation for create/patch/get/list tasks:
  - allowed in this sprint: `default`, `news_magazine`
  - unknown profile returns `400`

Verification highlights:
- Profile create/patch validation covered by task API tests.
- `news_magazine` deterministic 2-step planning validated via planner/task-step tests.
- Runner/profile integration validated with artifact persistence and grounding checks.

#### Sprint 5.4.6 — Python 3.11 Upgrade + Security Cleanup
- Upgraded backend runtime baseline to Python 3.11 and pinned local default via `.python-version`.
- Updated startup/runtime docs and startup script to create/use a 3.11 virtual environment path consistently.
- Remediated blocked dependency advisories in active requirements set, including:
  - `python-multipart` >= 0.0.22
  - `nltk` >= 3.9.3
  - `filelock` >= 3.20.3
  - `pillow` >= 12.1.1
- Kept Task 48 (`news_magazine`) reliability behavior stable after dependency/runtime upgrades (fuzzy link repair + partial publish path).

Verification highlights:
- Full suite passes on Python 3.11 in branch validation.
- `pip check` reports no broken requirements.
- Security audit reduced to residual advisories only; remaining items are explicitly tracked in release notes.

#### Deferred from Future Architecture (explicitly out of 5.4)
- Memory budgets (deferred post-5.4 unless prompt bloat metrics demand early pull-in).
- Layered memory semantics expansion (deferred).
- Event-driven heartbeat triggers (deferred).
- Dream-cycle consolidation (deferred).

## Phase 5.5 — Adaptive Chat Orchestration (Quality Parity)

**Goal**: close the quality gap between single-turn chat and task-mode execution on local models by adding optional task-like scaffolding to chat only when complexity warrants it.

**Why now**:
- Current task runs outperform chat on reliability because tasks use explicit planning, tool-grounding, and final synthesis.
- Chat remains intentionally lightweight, but this causes inconsistent quality for multi-part prompts on local 14B/16B models.

**Sprint 5.5.1 — Chat complexity detector**
- Add lightweight complexity scoring for chat turns (multi-part asks, high-stakes asks, tool-heavy asks).
- Route low-complexity requests through existing fast single-pass chat path.
- Route high-complexity requests to orchestrated chat path.

**Sprint 5.5.2 — Orchestrated chat path (non-task UX)**
- Add internal micro-plan for complex chat turns (2-3 steps max).
- Reuse existing tool + grounding patterns from task runner where safe.
- Keep response as a single chat answer (no task creation required).

**Sprint 5.5.3 — Grounding and output checks for chat**
- Add optional validation for news/research style answers:
  - link presence checks
  - invalid link rejection
  - empty-result retry policy
- Add “deep mode” switch in API/UI later (optional), defaulting to auto-routing.

**Sprint 5.5.4 — Observability and controls**
- Add counters for:
  - chat turns routed to orchestrated path
  - fallback/retry rates
  - latency delta vs single-pass path
- Add kill switch env flag to disable orchestrated chat instantly.

**Memory relevance follow-up (carryover)**
- Keep general retrieval/search from automatically raising memory relevance.
- Reintroduce relevance updates for explicit/direct recalls only:
  - direct user confirmation ("yes, that's correct")
  - successful task use where recalled memory materially informed outcome
  - explicit memory-open/recall actions in UI/API
- Track this as a scoring-policy hardening item before Phase 6 entry.

**Acceptance criteria**
1. Complex chat prompts show measurable quality improvement without forcing heavy orchestration on simple chat.
2. Median chat latency for simple prompts stays near current baseline.
3. No API-breaking changes; feature is additive and flag-gated.

## Phase 5.6 — Release Prep: Repository Realignment (Planning Only)

**Status**: Planned only. Do not execute until Phase 5.5 stabilization is complete.

**Goal**: align repository boundaries before Phase 6 so ownership, release flow, and open-source onboarding are clean.

Target repository layout:
- `FruitcakeAI` = backend/runtime app (current `fruitcake_v5` codebase)
- `FruitcakeAI_Client` = shared Apple client app for iOS and macOS (current `FruitcakeAi` codebase)

**Scope**
- Repo rename/move with full git history preservation.
- Remote/branch/README/docs link updates.
- CI/workflow path updates.
- Cross-repo references and setup docs cleanup.

**Out of scope (for this sprint)**
- New product features.
- Architecture changes unrelated to repo boundaries.
- Phase 6 cloud-routing implementation.

**Sprint 5.6.1 — Pre-move safety and freeze**
- Create pre-move checkpoint tags on both repos.
- Freeze feature work during the move window.
- Record rollback commands and branch protection expectations.

**Sprint 5.6.2 — Backend repo transition**
- Rename/move backend repo identity to `FruitcakeAI`.
- Update remotes, badges, clone URLs, and contributor docs.
- Validate backend startup, MCP health, and full test suite.

**Sprint 5.6.3 — Swift client repo transition**
- Rename/move Swift repo identity to `FruitcakeAI_Client`.
- Update project docs, build references, and CI workflows.
- Validate simulator/device build and API connectivity.

**Sprint 5.6.4 — Cross-repo release validation**
- Run end-to-end smoke flow (chat, task, RSS, push path).
- Confirm release tags and rollback path on both repos.
- Publish updated onboarding docs for open-source readiness.

**Sprint 5.6.5 — Knowledge Skills System (Admin-managed, additive)**
- Add DB-backed `skills` records (frozen content at install time) with scope support (`shared` and `personal`).
- Add admin two-step install flow: `POST /admin/skills/preview` then `POST /admin/skills/install` (no runtime URL fetch).
- Inject relevant skills in `UserContext.build()` with semantic gating and explicit prompt-budget caps.
- Keep skill tool grants additive but bounded: grants must intersect both persona `blocked_tools` and `resolve_execution_profile(...)` output.
- Add `/admin/skills/{id}/preview-injection` diagnostics for threshold tuning and explainability.

Guardrails locked for this sprint:
1. Query-empty behavior: do not inject all skills by default; only inject explicitly pinned/global-safe skills.
2. Install safety: URL preview fetch (if used) must enforce allowlist, timeout, and response-size limits.
3. Versioning/scope safety: avoid brittle global-name collisions by supporting update-friendly identity (versioned slug or scoped uniqueness).
4. Prompt budget: enforce per-skill and total skill token limits to prevent prompt bloat/drift.

Acceptance additions for Sprint 5.6.5:
1. Skills are additive only and cannot bypass persona or execution-profile tool restrictions.
2. Skill injection remains context-relevant and bounded by token budget.
3. Existing chat/task APIs and runner behavior remain backward compatible.
4. Admin diagnostics can explain why a skill did or did not inject for a sample query.

**Acceptance criteria**
1. Both repos are renamed/repositioned with history intact.
2. All documentation and remotes point to new canonical names.
3. Backend tests and iOS build checks pass after transition.
4. Rollback tags exist and are verified before Phase 6 work begins.

---

## Phase 6 Entry Criteria

Phase 6 starts only when all are true:
1. MCP error rate is below agreed threshold in daily use.
2. No unresolved duplicate-tool ambiguity exists in registry.
3. Admin diagnostics can identify failing MCP server causes without reading raw logs.
4. Execution profile seam is stable in task runs.
5. At least one week of stable Phase 5.4 soak is complete.

## Phase 6 — Cloud Judgment Routing (as needed)

**Dependency**: Depends on completion of the Phase 5.4 reliability gate.

**Trigger**: A user requests it, or local judgment quality on heartbeats is demonstrably causing missed-important / false-alarm patterns in daily use.

Cloud routing remains opt-in and justified by measured local judgment gaps.

This is the `config/autonomy.yaml` per-signal-type routing system from Roadmap 4. It's deferred until real-world data shows where local judgment fails and cloud routing is worth the data exposure tradeoff.

```yaml
# config/autonomy.yaml — added when Phase 6 is built
judgment:
  default: local
  routing:
    calendar_conflicts: local
    email_urgency: cloud        # opt-in per signal type
    financial_signals: local    # never
    document_content: local     # never
  cloud:
    provider: anthropic
    model: claude-haiku-4-5
    max_context_tokens: 500     # structural sanitization — forces abstraction
    audit_log: true
```

The `ContextSanitizer` and `JudgmentRouter` classes are built in this phase, not Phase 4. They solve a problem that requires real-world data to scope correctly.

---

## Phase 7 — Filesystem + Sub-Agent Spawning (2 weeks)

**Sprint 7.1** — Sandboxed filesystem MCP: `--allowed-paths /workspace`, per-user `workspace/{user_id}/`.

**Sprint 7.2** — Shell MCP: `docker run --network none`, 30s timeout, 8k output cap, explicit blocked commands list.

**Sprint 7.3** — Sub-agent spawning:

```python
async def spawn_agent(instruction: str, persona: str, timeout_seconds: int = 120):
    """Delegate to a specialist sub-agent. Child cannot escalate parent scopes."""
    child_session = create_child_session(parent=current_session, persona=persona)
    result = await run_agent(child_session, mode="task", max_turns=16)
    audit_log_child(parent=current_session, child=child_session)
    return result
```

**Sprint 7.4** — Graph Memory Foundation (MCP-informed, Fruitcake-native)

Goal: add durable relationship memory for long-horizon reasoning without adopting the MCP demo memory server as a production dependency.

Scope:
- Keep Fruitcake's existing memory stack as primary (semantic/procedural/episodic retrieval).
- Add a graph-memory layer in the same Postgres DB, user-scoped and auditable.
- Use MCP memory-server concepts (entity/relation/observation) as interface inspiration only.

Data model additions (Phase 7 candidate):
- `memory_entities` (id, user_id, name, entity_type, aliases, confidence, active, created_at, updated_at)
- `memory_relations` (id, user_id, from_entity_id, to_entity_id, relation_type, confidence, source_ref, created_at)
- `memory_observations` (id, user_id, entity_id, content, observed_at, confidence, source_ref, created_at)

Tool/API contract direction:
- `create_entities`
- `create_relations`
- `add_observations`
- `search_memory_graph`
- `open_memory_graph_nodes`

Guardrails:
- Persona-aware tool filtering via execution profile.
- Full provenance (`source_session_id`, `source_task_id`, webhook/run linkage).
- Confidence decay + conflict handling instead of silent overwrite.
- No cross-user graph joins by default.

Rollout:
1. Ship graph tables + service layer behind feature flag.
2. Add additive tool/API interfaces and admin diagnostics.
3. Run recall/grounding evals in soak before default enablement.
4. Keep cloud routing and graph memory decoupled; either can ship independently once Phase 6 gate is open.

## Phase 8 — Nightly Memory Extraction

**Trigger**: Phase 4 has been running for several weeks and real-world data shows what the agent misses.

A nightly background task reviews the previous 24 hours of chat sessions and extracts memories the agent didn't explicitly create via `create_memory`. This catches patterns that only become obvious in retrospect.

The extraction prompt reviews each session: *"Extract any facts about the user worth remembering. Return JSON: [{content, type, importance, expires_in_days}]."* New memories are deduplicated against existing ones before insertion.

---

## Phase 9 — Enterprise Fork

**Trigger**: Home version in stable daily use + confirmed business interest. Not speculative.

**Delta from home version**: SSO/LDAP/SAML · Teams (10–500 users) · ACL role matrix · Compliance export + retention · Docker Compose / K8s manifests · All judgment routing locked to `local` = air-gapped compliance guarantee · HIPAA/SOC 2 path · Mandatory audit logging.

**Why v5 already supports this**: persona=role mapping · library scopes→workspaces · LiteLLM model swap via env var · Memory scoped per-user already · `autonomy.yaml` all-local = one config change.

---

## Key Design Decisions

**Memory is the core differentiator, not task execution.**
OpenClaw's task execution model is simple and proven — adopt it. Where FruitcakeAI earns its advantage is in what the agent knows before it makes any tool call. Persistent per-user memory in pgvector, retrieved semantically, injected into every heartbeat and task prompt. This is not something OpenClaw can replicate without a major rearchitecture.

**LLM-as-judgment-router — adopted from OpenClaw.**
No pre-built context aggregator. The instruction is the context directive. The agent uses its normal tools to gather what it needs. Less code, more flexible, proven in production at scale.

**Drop `JudgmentRouter` and `ContextSanitizer` from Roadmap 4.**
They solved a problem that doesn't exist until cloud routing is actually opted into. Dead code in Phase 4 becomes tech debt before the product ships. Build them in Phase 6 when they're needed, with real-world data to inform exactly what needs sanitizing.

**Air-gap is automatic, not configured.**
Ollama runs locally. Tasks use the local model. The only thing that leaves the machine is the push notification body. No `autonomy.yaml` needed until Phase 6. Default is correct by construction.

**HEARTBEAT_OK suppression — adopted from OpenClaw.**
If the agent decides nothing needs attention, return the token and suppress delivery. No noise, no training users to ignore notifications. The suppression threshold (300 chars) is configurable.

**Active hours — first class, not optional.**
A heartbeat that can fire at 3am is a product-killing failure mode. `active_hours` is stored per-user and enforced at the heartbeat runner level. ⚠️ Three config sources must resolve to one: `heartbeat.yaml` defaults → user-level fields → per-task override. Resolution order is task → user → yaml. The `User` model needs `active_hours_start`, `active_hours_end`, `active_hours_tz` columns (add to Alembic migration in Sprint 4.1 alongside Task and DeviceToken).

**Approval workflow for irreversible actions.**
Primary documented failure mode in the OpenClaw community. Any tool in `APPROVAL_REQUIRED_TOOLS` pauses the task in `waiting_approval`, sends a push, and waits for the user to confirm from the Inbox tab. Safe-by-default is non-negotiable for a system that acts without the user present.

**Exponential retry for transient errors.**
A task that fails once because of a network timeout should not fail forever. Transient errors retry with backoff (30s → 1m → 5m → 15m → 60m). Permanent errors (auth failures, config errors) disable immediately.

**APNs JWT caching.**
The JWT must be cached and reused for up to 1 hour, regenerated 60 seconds before expiry. Generating a new JWT per delivery will hit Apple's rate limits under load.

**Memory is immutable — no edits, only deactivation.**
If a fact changes, the agent creates a new memory and marks the old one `is_active=False`. The full history of what the assistant knew and when is preserved. This is essential for debugging ("why did it mention that?") and for trust.

   → `status: "completed"` · `result` populated · `last_run_at` updated ✓

3. Create task outside active hours
   → task skipped silently ✓

4. Simulate transient error in agent loop

## Cursor Usage Notes

- **`app/memory/`** and **`app/autonomy/`** are new top-level modules — create from scratch
- **Agent core** (`core.py`) changes are surgical — preserve all existing `_normalize_tool_calls()` and `message.tool_calls` patterns
- **`create_memory` tool** goes into `app/agent/tools.py` alongside existing tools — same registry pattern
- **Memory embedding** reuses the same `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` model already used for document RAG — no new model setup
- **APScheduler wires into FastAPI lifespan** — not a separate process
- **Test heartbeat manually** via `POST /tasks/{id}/run` before enabling the scheduler
- **APNs sandbox** during all development — switch to production only when submitting to App Store
- **JWT caching** in `APNsPusher` — this is not optional, Apple will rate-limit uncached JWT generation
